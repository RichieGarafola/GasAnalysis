# Fuel Price Analysis

Fuel prices play a crucial role in our daily lives, impacting transportation costs, consumer spending, and overall economic stability. Understanding the dynamics of fuel prices and identifying key factors that influence their fluctuations is of great importance to individuals, businesses, and policymakers. This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of fuel price data, leveraging various data cleaning, data wrangling, and data visualization techniques to uncover valuable insights.

## Introduction

Fuel prices are subject to continuous fluctuations influenced by a multitude of factors, including supply and demand dynamics, global oil prices, taxes, and geopolitical events. Analyzing fuel price data allows us to identify long-term trends, seasonal patterns, and relationships among different locations. By applying statistical methods and visualizations to historical fuel price data, we aim to shed light on the underlying factors that contribute to price changes and provide actionable information for decision-making.

## Analysis Steps

The analysis follows a systematic approach to explore fuel price dynamics and relationships across different locations:

- 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Data cleaning and preparation are crucial to ensure data accuracy and integrity. In this step, the dataset is loaded, and various data cleaning techniques are applied. Duplicated rows are identified and removed, and missing values are handled appropriately to maintain data quality. The date column is converted to a datetime format, which enables further analysis and visualization.

- 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory data analysis techniques are employed to gain a deeper understanding of fuel price dynamics. This step involves visualizing fuel price time series for each location, identifying any overall trends or fluctuations. Monthly average prices are calculated and compared to uncover potential seasonal patterns or variations. Scatter plots are generated to explore relationships between fuel prices in different locations, providing insights into regional dynamics and market influences.

- 3. Price Distribution and Volatility Analysis
Price distribution and volatility analysis provide valuable insights into the range, variability, and potential outliers of fuel prices across different locations. Box plots and descriptive statistics are used to visualize the distribution of fuel prices, enabling a better understanding of central tendencies and variations. Volatility analysis quantifies the degree of price fluctuation, highlighting areas with higher or lower volatility.

- 4. Correlation Analysis
Correlation analysis explores the relationships between fuel prices in different locations. By creating a correlation matrix and heatmap, the strength and direction of correlations among fuel prices can be visualized. This analysis helps identify locations that move in tandem or exhibit divergent price patterns, providing insights into market dynamics and regional influences.

- 5. Additional Analysis Techniques
Additional analysis techniques are applied to gain further insights into fuel price dynamics. These techniques include seasonal decomposition to understand the seasonal components of fuel price data, autocorrelation plots to identify any time-dependent patterns or dependencies, moving averages to smooth out noise and highlight long-term trends, and price change analysis to evaluate the magnitude and direction of price fluctuations.
